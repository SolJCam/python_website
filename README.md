PYTHON PORTFOLIO BLOG SITE BUILT ON DJANGO

A fully functioning blog: If you’re looking to demonstrate your coding ability, a blog is a great way to do that. In this application, you will be able to create, update, and delete blog posts. Posts will have categories that can be used to sort them. Finally, users will be able to leave comments on posts.

A portfolio of your work: You can showcase previous web development projects here. You’ll build a gallery style page with clickable links to projects that you’ve completed.
